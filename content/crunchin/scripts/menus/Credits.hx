Ever since around late 2021 when the first update of this mod released, I was absolutely obsessed with this mod. It was my #1 hyperfixation for a LONG period of time, I made so many modcharts and cool coding visuals.. I listened to legacy over 4000 times in 2022....\n\nNeedless to say, it was an absolute shocker to be invited to this mod. I am eternally grateful to be able to put my name into a project that means this much to me, I'm extremely proud of all the work I put into this. \n\nI've put serious time into this and I've been on the mod for less than 6 months.. I ported the entire mod over to my personal engine, made EVERYTHING (yes literally everything) softcoded, reworked a TON of backend systems to be easier to manage, and coded all the new songs from scratch! Everything you are seeing or playing in this executable has been coded by me.\n\nA deep and genuine thanks to Grossalicious for allowing me to help with this project. I really cannot put into words how thankful I am for being able to work on this, it's a genuine dream come true.\n\nAlso srife ash decoy dom clover fredrick dan and scrumbo YOU'RE ALL FAT AS FUCK OK?"

Though everyone has helped me in some way, there are still some I feel inclined to point out specifically.\n\nTo Polar; If I was told to list every positive thing about you it would end up being a college length thesis, you just radiate light every time I've spoken to you, even during low points you manage to keep the energy high, never change.\n\nTo Frank; We may not have had the smoothest path all the time, but as one of the first people I spoke to in this group, your interactions helped me tear down the walls I had built around myself, and allowed me to be more outspoken with the rest of that initial team, thank you.\n\nTo Sevvy; Ever since we crossed paths you've just been fun to hang around, even in vcs where there isn't really much going on, it's just a comfortable place to be in, BUT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD EAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN MCDONALD'S YOU EAT THERE LIKE EVERY DAY FUCKER!!!!\n\nTo Grossa; I can't even begin to describe how much you mean to me, I wish I'd say it more often, but you are by far the most important person in my life.
